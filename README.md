# GameOfLife

John Conway's Game of Life done in C++. It has the following rules:



#1 A living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors will stay alive.

#2 A living cell with more than 3 neighbor cells will die due to overpopulation.

#3 A living cell with less than 2 cells in a 1 block radius will die due to loneliness.

#4 A dead cell with excactly 3 alive cells around it is born.



The population will develope untill eventually the population completely dies out or gets into a stable state, at which nothing changes anymore.
